# LUA-Published
LUA scripts for JETI radio systems

I would suggest to use Jeti Studio Transmitter to install each application individually.
In order to do that, please add the following URL to the application sources.

Go to the Jeti-studio Preference, on the "App sources" tab, add the above mentioned URL

Cheers
